This function uses the split() method to separate the key string into a
list of keys, and then uses a for loop to iterate through the list and
access the corresponding value in the nested object. If any of the keys
are not present in the object, the function returns None.

You can also add some more validation to check whether the key passed is
in the format of "key1/key2/key3" or not and also check whether the
object passed is a dictionary or not.
